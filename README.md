# To-Do-List
This is my first Java project. Visitors create a new task and select the level of urgency and importance of their task through a form and add it to a public To-Do List. In addition, visitors and edit and delete task. This project uses the Spring Boot framework for creating lightweight applications and easier dependency management.
